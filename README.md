# interdiff-rs

Rust [interdiff](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30603958/what-does-interdiff-do-that-diff-cannot) implementation.

This is a limited unfinished interdiff implementation, which works only for cases where two patches do not overlap.
The hunk merging algorithm, which is the last piece of the puzzle, is still under development.
